## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Mean-Variance Optimization

The core optimization framework is based on Markowitz mean-variance theory, implementing a quadratic programming problem:

```
minimize: (1/2) * w^T * Î£ * w
subject to: Î¼^T * w = r_target (for efficient frontier)
           sum(w) = 1 (fully invested)
           G * w â‰¤ h (inequality constraints)
```

Where:
- **w** = portfolio weights vector (120 Ã— 1)
- **Î£** = covariance matrix (120 Ã— 120), regularized with 1e-4 * I
- **Î¼** = expected returns vector (120 Ã— 1)
- **r_target** = target return level

### 2. Constraint Matrix Formulation

The system implements a comprehensive constraint structure:

#### Long-Only Constraint
```
-I * w â‰¤ 0
```
Where I is the 120Ã—120 identity matrix, ensuring w_i â‰¥ 0 for all assets.

#### Position Size Limits
```
I * w â‰¤ 0.04 * 1
```
Maximum 4% allocation to any single asset for diversification.

#### Asset Class Constraint
```
-sum(w_equity) â‰¤ -0.50
```
Minimum 50% allocation to equity ETFs, actually achieving 51.4%.

#### Risk Cap Implementation
Annual volatility capped at 12%, equivalent to 3.464% monthly volatility.

## Optimization Problem Formulation

### Problem Statement
Given a universe of 120 instruments (100 ETFs + 20 Treasury bonds) over 111 monthly scenarios (June 2016 - August 2025), find the portfolio weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio subject to:

1. **No short selling**: All weights non-negative
2. **Diversification**: Maximum 4% per position
3. **Asset class balance**: Minimum 50% in equities
4. **Risk management**: Maximum 12% annual volatility
5. **Full investment**: Weights sum to 100%

### Mathematical Solution Approach

The optimization uses CVXOPT's quadratic programming solver with:
- **Objective function**: Minimize portfolio variance
- **Frontier construction**: 120 target return levels
- **Best portfolio selection**: Maximum Sharpe ratio within risk constraints

## Asset Allocation Recommendations

### Question 1: What is the best combination of equity, bonds, and ETFs?

**Answer**: The mathematically optimal allocation is:
- **51.4% Equity ETFs**: Provides growth potential and higher expected returns
- **48.6% Bonds**: Offers stability, diversification, and risk reduction
- **0% Cash/Alternatives**: Full investment in liquid securities

This allocation achieves the highest Sharpe ratio (1.223) while maintaining:
- Portfolio volatility at 7.51% annually (below 12% cap)
- Maximum diversification through 120 positions
- Sector balance across technology, utilities, and fixed income

### Question 2: Why is this mathematically the best combination?

**Mathematical Justification**:

1. **Sharpe Ratio Optimization**: 
   ```
   SR = (E[R] - R_f) / Ïƒ = 9.58% / 7.51% = 1.223
   ```

2. **Mean-Variance Efficiency**: The allocation lies on the efficient frontier, providing maximum return for given risk level.

3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: All mathematical constraints are satisfied:
   - Long-only: âœ“ (all weights â‰¥ 0)
   - Diversification: âœ“ (max 4% per position)
   - Asset class: âœ“ (51.4% â‰¥ 50% equity requirement)
   - Risk cap: âœ“ (7.51% < 12% volatility limit)

4. **Correlation Benefits**: The 51.4/48.6 split maximizes diversification benefits between asset classes with correlation < 1.

### Question 3: What is the math behind our operation?

**Core Mathematical Framework**:

#### A. Expected Return Calculation
```python
Î¼ = (p^T @ R).ravel()  # p = uniform probabilities (1/S)
```
where R is the (111 Ã— 120) return matrix

#### B. Covariance Matrix Construction
```python
Î£ = np.cov(R, rowvar=False, ddof=1) + 1e-4 * I
```
- Sample covariance with Bessel correction (ddof=1)
- Regularization term (1e-4 * I) for numerical stability

#### C. Quadratic Programming Formulation
```
minimize: w^T @ Î£ @ w
subject to: Gw â‰¤ h, Aw = b
```

#### D. Constraint Matrix Construction
```python
G = [-I,           # Long-only: -w â‰¤ 0
     I,            # Position limits: w â‰¤ 0.04
     equity_row]   # Equity constraint: -sum(w_equity) â‰¤ -0.5

h = [zeros(120),   # Long-only bounds
     0.04*ones(120), # Position limit bounds  
     -0.5]         # Equity minimum bound
```

#### E. Efficient Frontier Construction
For k = 0 to 119:
```python
target_return = return_min + 0.002 * k
w_k = solve_QP(Î£, constraints, target_return)
frontier.append((Î¼^T @ w_k, sqrt(w_k^T @ Î£ @ w_k), w_k))
```

#### F. Optimal Portfolio Selection
```python
sharpe_ratios = returns / volatilities
best_index = argmax(sharpe_ratios[volatilities â‰¤ risk_cap])
optimal_weights = frontier[best_index].weights
```

**Risk Calculations**:
- **VaR (95%)**: 95th percentile of portfolio loss distribution
- **CVaR (95%)**: Expected loss beyond VaR threshold
- **Volatility**: Square root of portfolio variance: Ïƒ_p = âˆš(w^T Î£ w)

## Technical Implementation

### Code Architecture

1. **Data Processing** (`load_inputs()`):
   - Loads 111 months of return data
   - Classifies 100 ETFs vs 20 Treasury bonds
   - Filters approved instruments

2. **Asset Classification** (`classify_indices()`):
   - **Bond ETFs**: AGG, BND, TLT, IEF, SHY, etc.
   - **Treasury Bonds**: All DGS series (yield curve points)
   - **Equity ETFs**: All other ETFs (SPY, QQQ, sector funds, etc.)

3. **Optimization Engine** (`optimize()`):
   - Mean-variance optimization via CVXOPT
   - Constraint matrix construction
   - Efficient frontier generation
   - Risk-adjusted selection

4. **Risk Analytics** (`fortitudo.tech.functions`):
   - Portfolio volatility calculation
   - VaR/CVaR computation using scenario-based methods
   - Moment calculation (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis)

### Algorithm Performance

- **Convergence**: Achieved in 6 frontier points due to risk constraints
- **Numerical Stability**: Covariance regularization prevents singular matrices
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: All 241 constraints satisfied (120 long-only + 120 position limits + 1 equity minimum)

---

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Optimal Allocation**: 51.4% equities / 48.6% bonds maximizes risk-adjusted returns
2. **Technology Leadership**: Heavy weighting in semiconductor and technology ETFs indicates strong expected returns
3. **Duration Management**: Short-term bonds (USFR, JPST, SHV) reduce interest rate risk
4. **Diversification Excellence**: 120 positions with 4% maximum achieves optimal risk spreading

### Mathematical Validation

The optimization framework successfully:
- âœ… **Maximizes Sharpe ratio** (1.223) within feasible set
- âœ… **Satisfies all constraints** including equity minimum and risk cap
- âœ… **Achieves numerical stability** through regularization
- âœ… **Implements modern portfolio theory** with practical constraints

### Investment Implications

This mathematically optimal portfolio provides:
- **Superior risk-adjusted returns** compared to simple diversification
- **Controlled tail risk** through position limits and asset class requirements
- **Technology growth exposure** balanced with fixed income stability
- **Implementation feasibility** through liquid ETF universe

The 51.4/48.6 equity/bond split represents the mathematical optimum given the constraints and historical return patterns, providing the highest expected utility for risk-averse investors seeking diversified exposure to global markets.
