## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Mean-Variance Optimization

The core optimization framework is based on Markowitz mean-variance theory, implementing a quadratic programming problem:

```
minimize: (1/2) * w^T * Σ * w
subject to: μ^T * w = r_target (for efficient frontier)
           sum(w) = 1 (fully invested)
           G * w ≤ h (inequality constraints)
```

Where:
- **w** = portfolio weights vector (120 × 1)
- **Σ** = covariance matrix (120 × 120), regularized with 1e-4 * I
- **μ** = expected returns vector (120 × 1)
- **r_target** = target return level

### 2. Constraint Matrix Formulation

The system implements a comprehensive constraint structure:

#### Long-Only Constraint
```
-I * w ≤ 0
```
Where I is the 120×120 identity matrix, ensuring w_i ≥ 0 for all assets.

#### Position Size Limits
```
I * w ≤ 0.04 * 1
```
Maximum 4% allocation to any single asset for diversification.

#### Asset Class Constraint
```
-sum(w_equity) ≤ -0.50
```
Minimum 50% allocation to equity ETFs, actually achieving 51.4%.

#### Risk Cap Implementation
Annual volatility capped at 12%, equivalent to 3.464% monthly volatility.

## Optimization Problem Formulation

### Problem Statement
Given a universe of 120 instruments (100 ETFs + 20 Treasury bonds) over 111 monthly scenarios (June 2016 - August 2025), find the portfolio weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio subject to:

1. **No short selling**: All weights non-negative
2. **Diversification**: Maximum 4% per position
3. **Asset class balance**: Minimum 50% in equities
4. **Risk management**: Maximum 12% annual volatility
5. **Full investment**: Weights sum to 100%

### Mathematical Solution Approach

The optimization uses CVXOPT's quadratic programming solver with:
- **Objective function**: Minimize portfolio variance
- **Frontier construction**: 120 target return levels
- **Best portfolio selection**: Maximum Sharpe ratio within risk constraints

| **Equity ETFs** | 51.4% | 74 positions |
| **Bonds** | 48.6% | 46 positions |
| **Total** | 100.0% | 120 positions |

### Top 10 Holdings Analysis

| Rank | Ticker | Weight | Asset Type | Sector/Category |
|------|--------|--------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | SMH | 4.00% | Equity | Semiconductor ETF |
| 2 | XLK | 4.00% | Equity | Technology Sector |

### Key Observations

1. **Maximum diversification**: All top holdings at the 4% position limit
2. **Technology tilt**: Strong allocation to technology sectors (SMH, XLK, VGT, QQQ)
3. **Short-duration bonds**: Preference for short-term, low-duration fixed income
4. **Defensive positioning**: Utilities (XLU) provides defensive characteristics

## Risk Metrics and Performance

### Portfolio Risk Characteristics

| Metric | Monthly | Annualized |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Expected Return** | 0.765% | 9.58% |
| **Volatility** | 2.168% | 7.51% |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.353 | 1.223 |
| **95% VaR** | -3.992% | -13.83% |
| **95% CVaR** | -5.249% | -18.18% |

The optimized portfolio demonstrates:
- **Strong risk-adjusted returns**: Sharpe ratio of 1.223 (annualized)
- **Conservative volatility**: 7.51% annual volatility, well below 12% cap
- **Moderate tail risk**: 95% CVaR at -18.18% annually
- **Efficient frontier position**: Selected as maximum Sharpe ratio point

### Efficient Frontier Characteristics

- **Frontier points**: 6 feasible portfolios
- **Volatility range**: 1.410% to 2.168% (monthly)
- **Return range**: Various target levels up to 1.365% (monthly)
- **Optimal selection**: Best Sharpe ratio with risk cap compliance

## Asset Allocation Recommendations

### Question 1: What is the best combination of equity, bonds, and ETFs?

**Answer**: The mathematically optimal allocation is:
- **51.4% Equity ETFs**: Provides growth potential and higher expected returns
- **48.6% Bonds**: Offers stability, diversification, and risk reduction
- **0% Cash/Alternatives**: Full investment in liquid securities

This allocation achieves the highest Sharpe ratio (1.223) while maintaining:
- Portfolio volatility at 7.51% annually (below 12% cap)
- Maximum diversification through 120 positions
- Sector balance across technology, utilities, and fixed income

### Question 2: Why is this mathematically the best combination?

**Mathematical Justification**:

1. **Sharpe Ratio Optimization**: 
   ```
   SR = (E[R] - R_f) / σ = 9.58% / 7.51% = 1.223
   ```

2. **Mean-Variance Efficiency**: The allocation lies on the efficient frontier, providing maximum return for given risk level.

3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: All mathematical constraints are satisfied:
   - Long-only: ✓ (all weights ≥ 0)
   - Diversification: ✓ (max 4% per position)
   - Asset class: ✓ (51.4% ≥ 50% equity requirement)
   - Risk cap: ✓ (7.51% < 12% volatility limit)

4. **Correlation Benefits**: The 51.4/48.6 split maximizes diversification benefits between asset classes with correlation < 1.

### Question 3: What is the math behind our operation?

**Core Mathematical Framework**:

#### A. Expected Return Calculation
```python
μ = (p^T @ R).ravel()  # p = uniform probabilities (1/S)
```
where R is the (111 × 120) return matrix

#### B. Covariance Matrix Construction
```python
Σ = np.cov(R, rowvar=False, ddof=1) + 1e-4 * I
```
- Sample covariance with Bessel correction (ddof=1)
- Regularization term (1e-4 * I) for numerical stability

#### C. Quadratic Programming Formulation
```
minimize: w^T @ Σ @ w
subject to: Gw ≤ h, Aw = b
```

#### D. Constraint Matrix Construction
```python
G = [-I,           # Long-only: -w ≤ 0
     I,            # Position limits: w ≤ 0.04
     equity_row]   # Equity constraint: -sum(w_equity) ≤ -0.5

h = [zeros(120),   # Long-only bounds
     0.04*ones(120), # Position limit bounds  
     -0.5]         # Equity minimum bound
```

#### E. Efficient Frontier Construction
For k = 0 to 119:
```python
target_return = return_min + 0.002 * k
w_k = solve_QP(Σ, constraints, target_return)
frontier.append((μ^T @ w_k, sqrt(w_k^T @ Σ @ w_k), w_k))
```

#### F. Optimal Portfolio Selection
```python
sharpe_ratios = returns / volatilities
best_index = argmax(sharpe_ratios[volatilities ≤ risk_cap])
optimal_weights = frontier[best_index].weights
```

**Risk Calculations**:
- **VaR (95%)**: 95th percentile of portfolio loss distribution
- **CVaR (95%)**: Expected loss beyond VaR threshold
- **Volatility**: Square root of portfolio variance: σ_p = √(w^T Σ w)

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Optimal Allocation**: 51.4% equities / 48.6% bonds maximizes risk-adjusted returns
2. **Technology Leadership**: Heavy weighting in semiconductor and technology ETFs indicates strong expected returns
3. **Duration Management**: Short-term bonds (USFR, JPST, SHV) reduce interest rate risk
4. **Diversification Excellence**: 120 positions with 4% maximum achieves optimal risk spreading

### Mathematical Validation

The optimization framework successfully:

### Investment Implications

This mathematically optimal portfolio provides:
- **Superior risk-adjusted returns** compared to simple diversification
- **Controlled tail risk** through position limits and asset class requirements
- **Technology growth exposure** balanced with fixed income stability
- **Implementation feasibility** through liquid ETF universe

The 51.4/48.6 equity/bond split represents the mathematical optimum given the constraints and historical return patterns, providing the highest expected utility for risk-averse investors seeking diversified exposure to global markets.
